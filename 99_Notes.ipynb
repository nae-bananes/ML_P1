    "# (1) What is the difference between Conda vs PIP in installation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Both are the package managers. However, Conda is a **System** package manager while PIP is only a **Python** package manager. So we can manage packages of many other softwares - R, Django, Java, for example. But with PIP we can manage only Python packages. It also allows to **isolate** the necessary software stacks by projects. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes PIP misbehaves and installs packages in other environment then the virtual environment of choice. \n",

    "A virtualenv only encapsulates Python dependencies. A Docker container encapsulates an entire OS (Like VM). With a Python virtualenv, you can easily switch between Python versions and dependencies, but you're stuck with your host OS. With a Docker image, you can swap out the entire OS - install and run Python on Ubuntu, Debian, Alpine, even Windows Server Core.\n",
